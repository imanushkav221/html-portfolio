<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is Anushka, I'm a data analyst.</p>

<p>I have been working since last 3 years. Recently I got a kitten, and she has been demanding fresh tuna since day 1. This has made my budget tight and i'm unable to fulfill her demands. As a result, she has started biting my toes every night after I go to sleep.</p>

<p>So here I'm trying to learn new skills to fulfill my cat's evergrowing demands.</p>
